              The best first step to becoming a Web Developer is to start
              learning web development fundamentals, including an understanding
              of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
              and JavaScript.

              As you continue to grow your skills, you’ll need to choose an area
              of specialization. But what are the types of web development? All
              Web Developers are categorized into three main types: Front-End
              Developer, Back-End Developer then Full-Stack Developer.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
              Whatever your area of concentration, you’ll need to know how to
              use a handful of different programming languages for web
              development and web design. So, what are the most common
              programming languages? html, css, JavaScript

              There are also a number web design skills that are useful for Web
              Developers to have, with an understanding that responsive design
              is perhaps the most crucial. While Web Developers are not
              typically tasked with the overall site design, it’s an advantage
              for Developers to also have a solid understanding of common design
              principles. Front-End Developers, in particular, program the
              screens that users interact with – and they can be far more
              successful with a good grasp of user-centered design.
